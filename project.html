                    The complete name of Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is Avul Pakir Jainulabudeen Abdul Kalam. He was born on 15 October 1931 t o Jainulabudeen, a Tamil Muslim boat owner and Ashiamma, a housewife, at Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu. His family was poor and he had to do
                    assorted jobs to supplement family's income. He completed his schooling from the Schwartz Matriculation School at Ramanathapuram. He then went on to attend the Saint Joseph's College at Tiruchirappalli. He completed his graduation
                    in Physics in 1954 and then moved on to Madras to study aerospace engineering.After graduating from Madras Institute of Technology (MIT-Chennai) in 1960, Kalam joined Aeronautical Development Establishment of Defence Research and Development
                    Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. In1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of lndia's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully
                    deployed the Rohini satellite in near earth's orbit in July 1980. Joining ISRO was one of Kalam's biggest achievements in life. His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted
                    the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister, and the Secretary of Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December
                    1999. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni. Kalam served as the 11th President of India from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007. Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured
                    with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President. During his term as President, he was affectionately known as the People's President.
